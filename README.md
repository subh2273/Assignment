JUnit is a one of the most popular testing frameworks out there and it gives us the flexibility to use testing frameworks of your choice. I have used Cucumber Framework as it has several advantages . For the design pattern, I have used POM because of its reusability. Maven is used for the build automation.

Writing a test:
The cucumber features goes in the features library and should have the ".feature" extension.
